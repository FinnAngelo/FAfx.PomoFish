Pomofish is a simple pomodoro timer.

This is a `Minimum-Viable-Product`, and it is surprisingly useful.  
I'm using it _right now!_

The Pomodoro Technique
----------------------

If you don't know the [Pomodoro technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/), 
    a short summery is:

* Focus 100% on something for 25 minutes
    * Write down all of thems distractions/interuptions/vague brain wanderings 
        as they occur and [keep on swimming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hkn-LSh7es)
* Disengage for the next 5-10 minutes
    * plan your next 25 minutes
    * or chase up the interuptions
    * or have a cup of tea, whatever
    * Just _stop. your. brain._

--------
Features
--------

01. It counts down 25 minutes
02. It shows how many minutes to go, and if less than a minute it 
    shows how many seconds to go
    * It shows these minutes/seconds in the taskbar when minimised, 
        which is useful.
02. It locks Windows (as per `winkey-L`) at the end of 25 minutes
03. And then it closes
04. Yes. It is that awesome.
04. **It has a pretty ICON**
    * It surprised me how much more useable it is with an icon

----------
How to use
----------

01. Copy the `Pomofish.exe` and the `Pomofish.exe.config` files to a folder
02. Run `Pomofish.exe` and pin it to your taskbar
03. You now have 25 minutes until your PC locks
04. When your PC locks... go have a cup of tea. Plan your next pomo, 
    whatever
05. After 5-10 minutes, start a new Pomo using your new taskbar link

A couple of hints
-----------------

Disclaimer:

* This works for me. Your brain may/probably works differently

But here is what works for me:

* Accept that 4 _completed_ pomos per day is pretty good.
* Write down your singular task for a pomo
    * A pomo is 100% of your attention, so don't waste a second of it
    * A pomo stops at the end of the pomo... so (again) don't waste a 
        second of it
* Your Pomos will be interupted
    * Learning how to redirect the interuption is _a major lesson_ for a pomo
        * Say: 'Hi `whoever`, I'm just working on `singular task` for `remaining` minutes
            Can I finish this?'
    * Learning how to accept an interuption is _a harder lesson_ for a pomo
* For the first month, plan for no more than 4 pomos per day
    * Pomos are awesome _hard work_
    * Like going to the gym, please be kind to yourself when you start

-------------
Other rubbish
-------------

* I used to have _lots_ more code for this. Check the GitHub history
* But now it is stripped back to the absolute minimum to pass the MS analysis tools
* Hmm... this really needs some sort of installer
    * Just something to pin it to the start bar
* And a website and an executable rather than just source code and... more!!!
